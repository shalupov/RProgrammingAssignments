https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Project description for the course as follows:

* You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In this repository:

* *run_analysis.R*: all required functions and their description
* *CodeBook.md*: output description usable for subsequent data processing

Follow [*CodeBook.md*](CodeBook.md) for further information.
